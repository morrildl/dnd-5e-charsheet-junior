A US Half-Letter (5.5" x 8.5") D&D 5e character sheet, suitable for use in a disc-bound notebook.

You should not use this. You should buy something like [Cantrips Media character
sheets](https://cantripsmedia.com/products/character-sheets-for-d-d-5e-player-size-notebooks?variant=44951519854819)
which inspired this project. I did my version because I pedantically wanted a double-sided character
sheet, where Cantrips' are laid out side-by-side. Also, I kinda did it just to see if I could.

The layout in [charsheet.html](charsheet.html) is for a single US Letter (8.5" x 11") sheet. Once
printed, it yields two copies of the character sheet after the US Letter "parent" page is cut in
half into two US Half-Letter (5.5" x 8.5") sheets.

The layout contains margins sufficient to allow holes to be punched in the half-Letter "child"
sheets for use a disc-bound notebook system.

This document could be adjusted to A5 with minor edits to the CSS, updating the dimensions.

To use:

1. `git clone` the repo, or even just download `charsheet.html` and the `assets/` directory
2. Open the file in a browser, via a `file:///` URL
3. Print the HTML page (ctrl-P)

Alternatively, if you don't want to make any tweaks, just download and print
[charsheet.pdf](charsheet.pdf).
